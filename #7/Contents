You are expected to enhance your Movie Ticket Booking System by incorporating a graphical user interface (GUI).
This system should allow users to manage customers, create ticket bookings, and view information through an interactive interface built with Java Swing. 
The GUI should include buttons, dialog boxes, and text areas to provide a user-friendly experience.
As you can see, there is a title for the application. Furthermore, there exits four JButtons for the following actions:
● Add Customer: Adds a customer to the system.
● Create Booking: Creates a Movie Booking for a Customer.
● Display All Customers: Displays the Customers that have been created thus far.
● Display All Bookings: Displays the Bookings that have been created thus far.
The Add Customer button should open a dialog that allows the user to:
● Select the customer type: Regular Customer, Loyalty Member, or Corporate Client.
● Enter the customer's name and email.
● The newly created customer should be stored in the system and displayed in subsequent views.
The Create Booking button should open a dialog that allows the user to:
● Enter the customer ID.
● Input details such as movie name, cinema name, show date, show time, and the number of tickets.
● Select the ticket type: Regular, Premium, VIP, or IMAX.
The booking should calculate the total cost and apply the customer's discount based on their type.
The Display All Customers button should open a dialog:
● Displaying all customers with their details, including name, email, and customer type.
The Display All Bookings button should open a dialog:
● Displaying all bookings, including movie name, cinema name, show date, show time, ticket count, and total cost.
Furthermore, you are required to ensure that error messages are displayed in dialogs for invalid inputs, such as:
● Invalid customer ID.
● Non-numeric values for ticket count.
