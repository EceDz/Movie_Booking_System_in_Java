Accordingly, you are required to develop a Movie Ticket Booking System, where you will be generating TicketBooking items and display the information that they hold. Every TicketBooking should also include the overall cost (payment due).
You are asked to create a TicketBooking class that includes the following variables:
movieName: Stored as a String, representing the name of the movie.
showDate: Stored as a String, representing the date of the movie show (e.g., "2024-09-10").
showTime: Stored as a String, representing the time of the movie show (e.g., "18:00").
ticketPrice: Stored as an int, representing the price per ticket.
ticketCount: Stored as an int, representing the number of tickets booked.
seatType: Stored as an enum called SeatType with the following options: Regular, Premium, VIP.
Your class should have a displayInfo() method, which would display the information about the TicketBooking. 
This method should call the calculateTotalPrice() method to calculate the total amount the customer will have to pay for their booking. 
You should create a TicketBooking object and insert all the data via its constructor. When displaying the information, all details should be collected via getter methods. 
Your implementation must be constructed as two separate Java files.You should create few TicketBooking objects and show their information and their total cost by implementing a menu as shown below;
1. Create new Ticket Booking
2. Display all Ticket Bookings
0. Exit
PS: Please use object arrays but not ArrayLists.
