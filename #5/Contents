You are required to enhance the Movie Ticket Booking System by integrating customer types and applying polymorphism. 
Customers will now be classified into three types, each with unique pricing behaviors:
● RegularCustomer: Standard customers with no discounts.
● LoyaltyMember: Customers who receive a 10% discount on all bookings.
● CorporateClient: Customers who receive a 15% discount for bulk orders (total cost above $500).
You are required to create an interface Customer with the following methods:
● int getCustomerId(): Returns the customer ID.
● String getName(): Returns the customer's name.
● String getEmail(): Returns the customer's email.
● double calculateDiscountedPrice(double totalCost): Calculates the discounted price based on the customer type.
● void displayInfo(): Displays customer information.
For this purpose, you should maintain a list of all customers in the system which in turn will allow users to add new customers 
and view a list of all customers. You already maintain a list of all bookings, you should now associate a booking with a specific customer by customerId.
You should use existing functionality to create and manage bookings. Calculate and display the original and discounted costs for each booking.
The discounted prices should be calculated dynamically using the calculateDiscountedPrice method in the Customer interface.
