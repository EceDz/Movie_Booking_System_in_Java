You are expected to improve your existing Movie Ticket Booking by incorporating ArrayList type data structures from the package Collections. 
Furthermore, you are required to make use of the remove() method to delete items from an ArrayList.
1. Create new Ticket Booking
2. Create new Ticket Booking with Ticket Type
3. Display all Ticket Bookings
4. Display the total number of bookings
5. List the bookings for a specific cinema
6. Remove bookings in a specific cinema
7. Exit
As part of this assignment, you need to add two new menu items to your existing reservation system. 
Namely; item 5 “List the bookings for a specific cinema” and item 6 “Remove bookings in a specific cinema”. 
You should set the size of your Booking array to 3 and always fill all of them with data – the size of the array should be 3 and you should always enter at least 3 bookings.
When the user selects the 5th option, the system should ask the user to input the name of the cinema that the user would like to list the bookings of.
Next, even though it is possible to parse the Bookings array using do/while loop, the application should convert the Bookings array into a List and traverse it using List Iterator’s hasNext() method.
If the Iterator’s pointer indicates a booking cinema which has the name provided initially, it should print those booking details on the screen.
When the user selects the 6th option, the application initially should request the user to input a cinema name. 
As soon as the city name is provided, it should convert the existing Bookings array into a List and parse the cinema names to check whether any of the reservations are made for that specific cinema. 
If any found, it should remove that booking from the list using List’s remove() method. Then the existing Bookings array should be set to null and the resulting List should then be inserted to the Bookings array.
